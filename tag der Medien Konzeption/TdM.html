    <h2 id=headline>The Idea</h2>

    <p id=text>Classical music lovers are typically more introverted but are also at ease with themselves and the world around them. They are creative and have a good sense of self-esteem.
    Fans of the top 40 pop hits tend to be extroverted, honest, and conventional. While pop music lovers are hardworking and have high self-esteem, researchers suggest that they tend to be less creative and more uneasy...
    <br>
    <br>
    You see, the taste in music tells more about your personality that you might think. At least more than looks do.
    We live in a world, where to be biased is a totally normal phenomenon. We tend to look at photos from others and judge way to fast. If the person on the photo looks not appealing to you, you will never give his or hers character a chance.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sound&Bound should be a portal to meet new people, without the focus on dating or looks. But how?
    Simply through the magic of music.
    </p>
    <h2 id=headline>The Function</h2>

    <p id=text>Everybody knows Tinder, Lovoo, etc.. These superficial apps where you search for someone to sleep with purely based on looks.
    While the user operates our app similiar there are a few disparities. First of all, our user shouldn`t be on the search for a fast hookup, but rather for a fun conversation. Second, instead of swiping profilepictures left and right, the user has to like or dislike songs which are
    displayed. If he does that for a while, he „matches“ with someone who has the same taste in music and can now chat with this person right away. There is no picture, neither a gender. There is just the personality behind the musictaste.
    <br>
    <br>
    Of course they can change numbers and live their lifes happy ever after. </p>
    <h2 id=headline>The Design</h2>
   
    <p id=text>Young, hipp and a little cringe. Like this whole project... Bubblegum-Pink and Icecream-Blue, not just tasty but also catchy. </p>
